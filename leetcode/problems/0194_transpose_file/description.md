# 194 Transpose File

Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

Example:

If `file.txt` has the following content:

```text
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```

Output the following:

```text
name alice ryan
age 21 30
```
